/**
 * This class is responsible for handling the submission of normalized documents
 * to an AWS S3 bucket. It extends the AbstractNormalizingPostSubmitHandler, leveraging
 * its method to normalize the submitted data before sending it to S3.
 *
 * The class uses AWS SDK's S3Client to facilitate interactions with S3, and
 * Jackson's ObjectMapper to serialize the data into JSON format according to
 * the required configurations.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Serializes normalized questionnaire data into JSON format.
 * - Sends the serialized document to an S3 bucket, using the document's unique
 *   identifier as the object key.
 *
 * Constructor Details:
 * - The constructor accepts an S3Client and an ObjectMapper as parameters.
 * - The ObjectMapper is configured to order map entries by keys to ensure
 *   consistent serialization output.
 *
 * Key Overrides:
 * - The sendDocument method is overridden to handle the process of constructing
 *   and uploading the JSON document to S3.
 *
 * Logging:
 * - Debug logs are provided to track the process of sending documents to S3.
 * - Errors encountered during the JSON serialization process are logged.
